        <h1>A little about me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is <span><html lang="sv"> Johan Stening</span>, often just called "Stening". I grew up in in a suburb of Kalmar called Lindsdal and have lived there ever since. Right now me, my mom and dad live in the house and my sister is in Stockholm studying.
            On my spare time I usually sit on skype with some friends, playing some games or just chatting. I actually spend a lot of time modding my games if there is something I am not pleased with, I always try to learn some way to edit the game to my liking (only in offline games of course).
       </p>
       <h1>How I ended up at Teknikh√∂gskolan</h1>
       <p>
           Before I applied for this class I was searching for a job. I had recently graduated from another university, though the job scene was not as good as I had hoped. The University before was alot about programming PLC:s (Programmable Logic Controller).
       </p>
       <p>
           One day I got a call from a friend, he asked if I wanted to eat some lunch. After we had eaten he asked if I wanted to check out this "open house" at a university for programming, and I had nothing planned that day so I gladly tagged along.
           I spoke with the guys at the university, got some more information about what they do and later I found myself applying so I had a chance to do something if I did not get a job.
           I had an idea about programming since I had programmed alot of PLC:s, but I wanted to try this kind of coding so I took an online course in C#.
           Maybe I got lucky and got a great tutorial maker, but I thought it was great. It was not at all as I had imagined writing code, it was alot more forgiving with the software telling me what I did wrong, actively making it easier with the intellisense feature, etc.
